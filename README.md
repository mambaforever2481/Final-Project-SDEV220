# Final-Project-SDEV220
Originally Planned to write the code via Django, but figured for real world data science usage, a container application would be more suited. This application is scalable and can import any CSV file. 
This application can be used on any computer running Python, or can be converted to a .exe. Used tKinter for the GUI.
